# Roadmap

We are continuously working on enhancing Zario to provide robust and flexible logging capabilities for the Node.js ecosystem.

## Completed Features
- **Console & File Transports**: Reliable local logging with rotation and compression.
- **HTTP Transport**: Remote log ingestion with retry logic.
- **Child Loggers**: Hierarchical context and configuration inheritance.
- **Asynchronous Mode**: Non-blocking I/O for high-performance apps.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Sophisticated logic for granular log control.
- **Structured Logging**: Powerful enrichment pipeline for metadata.
- **Log Aggregation**: Batch and time-based processing.

## Future Plans

### Native Integrations
- **Syslog Support**: Native syslog transport for Unix/Linux systems.
- **Database Transports**: Built-in transports for MongoDB, Redis, and PostgreSQL.
- **Elasticsearch Integration**: Optimized transport with bulk indexing support.

### Features
- **WebSocket Transport**: Real-time log streaming for monitoring dashboards.
- **Log Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive log data.
- **Performance Metrics**: Built-in dashboard for throughput and latency statistics.
- **React Native Support**: Bringing Zario to mobile development.

### Optimizations
- **Zero-Allocation Logging**: Exploring techniques to further reduce GC pressure.
- **Enhanced Querying**: Utilities for parsing and searching local log files.
