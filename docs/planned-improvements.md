# Planned Improvements for zario

We are continuously working on enhancing `zario` to provide even more robust and flexible logging capabilities. Here are some of the key features and updates we are planning for future releases:

## Upcoming Features

*   **Syslog Support**: Native syslog transport for Unix/Linux systems, enabling integration with existing syslog infrastructure and centralized logging solutions.

*   **WebSocket Transport**: Real-time log streaming via WebSocket connections, ideal for live monitoring dashboards and remote log inspection in development environments.

*   **Database Transports**: Built-in transports for popular databases (MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL) to persist logs directly to your data store.

*   **Log Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive log data, ensuring that log entries remain secure both in transit and at rest.

*   **Performance Metrics Dashboard**: Built-in metrics and analytics to monitor logger performance, including throughput, latency, and aggregation statistics.

*   **React Native Support**: Official support for React Native applications, enabling mobile developers to use `zario` for comprehensive logging across platforms.

*   **Elasticsearch Integration**: Native transport optimized for Elasticsearch with bulk indexing support and Kibana-ready structured logging.

## Ongoing Improvements

*   **Performance Optimizations**: Continuous efforts to reduce overhead and improve log throughput. This includes exploring more efficient ways to handle log processing and transport to ensure `zario` remains one of the fastest logging libraries available.

*   **Enhanced Querying**: Advanced log querying capabilities with support for complex search queries, filtering, and aggregation operations.

We appreciate your feedback and contributions as we continue to evolve `zario`. Stay tuned for these exciting updates!
